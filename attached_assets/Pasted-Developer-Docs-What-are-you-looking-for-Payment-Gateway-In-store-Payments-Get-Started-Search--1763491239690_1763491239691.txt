Go Live Process
After completing your integration, share the testing URL/App with the PhonePe Integration Team for a final sanity check.
Once the integration is verified in UAT, UAT Sign-off will be provided, and Production credentials will be shared with you by PhonePe.

Follow the steps below to migrate from UAT to Production and go live:

1. Replace Host URLs
Update the API host endpoints from UAT to Production as follows:

APIs	Production Host URLs
Auth Token API	https://api.phonepe.com/apis/identity-manager
Other APIs (Payment, Status, Refund)	https://api.phonepe.com/apis/pg
2. Replace Client ID and Secret Key
Use your Production credentials:
Replace the UAT Client ID and Client Secret with your Production Client ID and Client Secret to generate the Production Auth Token.

3: Generate Production Auth Token
Call the Auth Token API using your production credentials and use the generated token in all production API calls:

Payment Initiation
Order Status
Refund
SDK Configuration for Production
Android SDK
Initialize the PhonePe SDK using PhonePeEnvironment.RELEASE
Set enableLogging to false
appId is optional and can be passed as null or ""
Code Reference

val result = PhonePeKt.init(
  context = this,
  merchantId = "MID",
  flowId = "FLOW_ID",
  phonePeEnvironment= PhonePeEnvironment.RELEASE,
  enableLogging = false,
  appId = null 
)
iOS SDK
Initialize the PhonePe SDK with environment as .production
Set enableLogging to false
Code Reference

let ppPayment = PPPayment(environment: .production,
                          merchantId: "MERCHANT_ID",
                          enableLogging: false)
You are now ready to go live with your PhonePe integration in the Production environment.
With UAT successfully completed and the Production credentials in place, all necessary steps have been covered to ensure a smooth transition.

Hybrid SDK
Initialize the PhonePe SDK init method as below
environment as PRODUCTION
merchantId with Production MID
Make sure the enableLogging flag is set to False in Production.
We wish you a successful go-live and continued operational excellence.
